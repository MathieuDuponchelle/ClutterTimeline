The purpose of this project is to provide a timeline widget written in Gtk, embedding a timelineCanvas
written in Clutter.

It will be heavily relying on GES, so only re-usable in a GES context.

For now you can launch the project either as stand alone, but it will be static and quite frustrating,
or with ipython that way :

ipython
>>> %gui gtk3
>>> %run timeline.py /path/to/media/file

A sample ipython session might be:

>>> tl = widget.timeline.bTimeline
>>> layer = tl.append_layer()
>>> asset = widget.project.list_assets(GES.UriClip)[0]
>>> clip = asset.extract()
>>> widget.addClipToLayer(layer, asset, 0, 20, 0)
>>> whatever ...
